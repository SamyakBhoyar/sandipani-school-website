        <p>The Campus Life (abbreviated TSL)[6] is a student newspaper covering the Claremont Colleges (5Cs), a consortium of liberal arts colleges in Claremont, California. It is published weekly each Friday during the academic year, typically spans roughly ten pages per issue, and is primarily funded by the student governments of the colleges.[1]

            The paper is the oldest college newspaper in Southern California, having been published since 1889.[4][7] It is also the largest and most widely distributed campus newspaper at the 5Cs, with a significant readership among students, staff, faculty, alumni, and members of the Claremont community.[1] It maintains a staff of around 120 students, including writers, columnists, photographers, videographers, designers, copy specialists, business associates, and editors.[2][3]

            TSL operates out of Room 101 in Walker Hall on the northern portion of Pomona College's campus.
